 Screen-Key-Mon v0.1
=====================

 This project forks the well known 'key-mon 1.7.1' from Scott Kirkwood 
 and forks 'Screenkey 0.2' also a well known project by Pablo Seminario 
 with the goal to merge both wonderfull projects, so that both projects 
 complete each other. Hence the name Screen-Key-Mon. 
 
 At present day, Screenkey has not been incorporated yet, but only Key-
 Mon was adapted in order to play nicely with a standard Screenkey v0.2 
 installation.
 
 Read more about the changes in the Status section of this document.

 All development and testing is done with Ubuntu 10.10

 Status
========

 Currently only Key-Mon was modified to play nicely with Screenkey. Next 
 Release (0.2) will merge both sources and allow to start both Projects 
 as with just one file.

 Screen-Key-Mon v0.1 has compared to Keymon v1.7 a few minor changes and 
 a new default theme besides the documentation of key-mon except the notes 
 below is still valid.

 Added features:
  -c is now a shortcut for --mouse (c for cursor)
  
  -k, --keys is defaulted to true
   use --nokeys to turn off the current pressed key
   
  -b, --buttons is defaulted to true
   use --nobuttons to turn off all shown keys
  
  modern2 is now the default theme

 Changed behaviour and defaults:
  --meta (super or windows key) is defaulted to true
  --backgroundless is now true by default

 Requirements
==============

 Since no *.deb package exists the software needs to be compiled. Some 
 additional packages may be needed in order to do so:
 
 	user@shell:~$ sudo apt-get install python-gtk2-dev
 	user@shell:~$ sudo apt-get install python-xlib
  
 Installation
==============

 When the requirements are fullfilled, clone, or download the project 
 from github:
 
  https://github.com/derRaphael/Screen-Key-Mon 
  
 extract it if neccssary and run from shell:

	user@shell:~/path/to/skm/<version>$ sudo python setup.py install
	
 You also might want to use the included skm-helper.sh bash script, 
 which allows to do standard tasks without the hassle of typing or
 pasting various commands, simply use:
 
	user@shell:~/path/to/skm/<version>$ sudo ./skm-helper.sh
 

 Deinstallation/Removement/Rebuilding

 removement is fairly easy:
 
 	user@shell:~$ sudo rm -rf /usr/share/pyshared/screenkeymon
  user@shell:~$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/screenkeymon
  user@shell:~$ sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/screen-key-mon
  user@shell:~$ sudo rm -rf ~/.config/screen-key-mon/
  
 When rebuilding the project, you want to remove python's build directory 
 aswell
 
  user@shell:~/path/to/skm/<current-version>$ sudo rm -rf build

 You also might want to use the included skm-helper.sh bash script, 
 which allows to do standard tasks without the hassle of typing or
 pasting various commands, simply use:
 
	user@shell:~/path/to/skm/<version>$ sudo ./skm-helper.sh
